Elaine Reiche, PhD, ATC, CSCS

Orthopedic researcher and data scientist specializing in the analysis of biomechanical, clinical, and neurophysiological data to improve decision-making in sports medicine and rehabilitation. My work integrates machine learning, statistical modeling, and signal processing to produce clinically meaningful, reproducible insights.
